name: qwen-mm-plugins-mhs
description: Operate physical hardware (cameras, sensors, lamps, arms, lab equipment) through Model Hardware Standard adapters — mhs_discover (what devices exist), mhs_meta_info (what one device can do and its safety limits), mhs_read (sensor values, camera frames), mhs_write (send a command), mhs_health_check (is it alive), mhs_reset (recover or emergency-stop). Use whenever a task involves reading from or controlling a real device rather than a file.

# Qwen-MM-Plugins MHS

You have `qwen-mm-plugins-mhs` MCP tools available. They operate **real hardware**. MHS is to hardware
what MCP is to tools: one fixed six-tool surface, with everything device-specific behind an *adapter*
that the hardware's owner runs. You never learn a per-device API — you ask the device what it can do.

The tool surface does not grow when new hardware appears. A new device shows up in `mhs_discover`
because someone started an adapter for it.

Check the `qwen-mm-plugins-mhs` tools in your tool list for full schemas.
For worked examples, see the [MHS cookbook](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-mm-plugins-hub/plugins/mhs/cookbook/).

## The loop

1. **`mhs_discover`** — always first. Device ids come from here, never from a guess. Ids look like
   `<adapter>/<device_id>`; a bare id works when only one adapter has it.
2. **`mhs_meta_info`** — before your first `mhs_write` to a device. This is where you learn the
   capability's parameters, units, permitted ranges, and which writes need confirmation. Skipping it
   means guessing at values that move physical things.
3. **`mhs_read`** — sensor values, current settings, camera frames. A frame comes back as an image you
   can look at directly. Read-only; safe to repeat.
4. **`mhs_write`** — the only tool that changes the world. See below.
5. **`mhs_health_check`** — after anything unexpected, and before a sequence of commands. Never cached.
   Call it with no `device_id` to survey everything when you don't yet know what's wrong.
6. **`mhs_reset`** — `mode="soft"` clears an error and returns the device to idle;
   `mode="estop"` stops it now.

## Writing to hardware

- **Read the metadata first.** Ranges and units are declared per device; nothing is universal.
- **A refusal is information, not an obstacle.** If a write is refused for exceeding a *hard* safety
  limit, the device has said that value is unsafe. Do not look for a way around it — report it.
  `confirm=true` cannot override a hard limit and trying is not a plan.
- **`confirm=true` is for deliberate acts,** not for retrying. Use it when metadata says a capability
  requires confirmation, or to exceed a *soft* limit you have a specific reason to exceed. If a human
  hasn't asked for the consequence, don't confirm it.
- **A failed write is not automatically retryable.** Call `mhs_health_check` first. Repeating a command
  at a device in an error state is how a stuck actuator becomes a broken one.
- **Say what you actually did.** Report the device id, capability, and values you sent, and what the
  device answered — not just "done".

## When something is wrong

If a device behaves unexpectedly, or you are unsure whether a command took effect, `mhs_reset` with
`mode="estop"` first and diagnose second. It needs no confirmation, because anything standing between
you and a stop is a hazard. Then tell the user what you stopped and why.

If a device does not implement reset, the tool says so — that device cannot be stopped through you,
and the user needs to know that immediately.

## Configuration

Adapters are listed in `~/.qwen-mm-plugins/mhs-devices.json` (override with `QWEN_MM_MHS_DEVICES`):

```json
{"adapters": [{"name": "lab-cam", "url": "http://192.168.1.20:8800"}]}
```

If that file is missing, the tools say so and show the shape to create. `mhs_discover` reloads it and
queries every adapter on each call; device lists and health are never cached. An empty `adapters`
list is valid. `QWEN_MM_MHS_CACHE_TTL` (default 60s) applies only to metadata, which discovery and
reset also invalidate.

No hardware to hand? Run the bundled mock adapter and point the registry at it:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "msgpack>=1.1,<2"
python3 references/mock_adapter.py --port 8800
```

It serves a simulated camera (with a hard limit on exposure and a soft limit on gain) and a lamp whose
`power` write requires confirmation — enough to exercise the whole loop.

## Adding hardware

Nothing about a new device belongs in this plugin. An adapter is a plain HTTP server — any language —
and it is registered by one line in the registry file. The full contract is
[`references/adapter_protocol.md`](references/adapter_protocol.md), and
[`references/mock_adapter.py`](references/mock_adapter.py) contains working device implementations.
Its shared HTTP + MessagePack layer is [`references/adapter_server.py`](references/adapter_server.py).

### You can write the adapter yourself

If the user has hardware you can reach — a device file, a `/sys` node, a serial port, a gRPC or HTTP
service, a vendor CLI — but no MHS adapter for it, write one and use it in the same session. Nothing
needs restarting: the registry file is re-read on every call, and devices are discovered from adapters
at runtime.

1. Read `references/adapter_protocol.md`. Do not guess the shapes from these tool descriptions.
2. Copy `references/mock_adapter.py` together with `references/adapter_server.py` and replace the
   device's `read`/`write`/`health`/optional `reset` methods with real I/O. Keep HTTP routing in the
   shared server; keep parameter validation, resource lifecycle, and cancellation in the device.
   Keep it outside this plugin's directory — an adapter belongs with its hardware.
3. Install `msgpack>=1.1,<2` in the adapter environment. Return image `data` as raw bytes.
   Run it in the background on a free port, and check it started before going further.
4. **Check it against the protocol before registering it:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m qwen_mm_plugins_mhs.verify http://127.0.0.1:8800
   ```
   This is read-only — it never writes and never resets — and it names exactly what is wrong
   (missing `blocks`, malformed image data, a forgotten `direction`, an unbounded writable parameter,
   an error path that answers 200). Fix everything it reports as ✗ before going on; read the ! lines
   too. Do not skip this because the adapter "looks right" — the failures it catches are the ones that
   otherwise surface later as a tool error you cannot explain.
5. Add it to `~/.qwen-mm-plugins/mhs-devices.json` (create the file if absent, and **preserve any
   adapters already listed** — do not overwrite someone else's registry). Write the updated JSON to
   a temporary file in the same directory, then atomically replace the registry so a concurrent call
   cannot read a half-written file.
6. `mhs_discover` — the device is there immediately. The same call reflects removed registrations,
   changed adapter addresses, and unreachable adapters. Then proceed with the normal loop.

Rules for an adapter you wrote yourself, because you are now on both sides of the safety boundary:

- **Start read-only.** Declare `direction: "read"` for every capability until the user has confirmed
  they want the device actuated. A read-only declaration is enforced by the host, so it costs nothing
  and it means an accidental `mhs_write` cannot reach the hardware at all.
- **Declare real `safety_limits`.** The host enforces exactly what you declare, so this is the cheapest
  place to make an unsafe command impossible. Do not declare a range wider than you can justify from
  the device's documentation.
- **Mark consequential writes `requires_confirm: true`.**
- **Never fake success.** Writes and resets must return a boolean `ok`: `true` only when accepted,
  `false` when declined. Return 405 when reset is unsupported. A missing or invalid `ok` leaves
  execution unconfirmed, including whether an emergency stop completed.
  You will be the one misled later.
- **Tell the user what you built before you use it to move anything** — what device it talks to, which
  capabilities it exposes, and which of them can change physical state. An adapter you wrote has had no
  review; say so.

## Relationship to other capabilities

- A camera frame from `mhs_read` is an ordinary image: analyze it with `qwen-mm-plugins-api`
  (`vision_chat`, `ocr`, `grounding`) or annotate it with `qwen-mm-plugins-core` (`crop`, `draw_bbox`).
- On a text-only host (`QWEN_MM_NATIVE_MODE=0`) frames arrive as generated captions instead of images;
  the loop is unchanged.
- This capability reads no files and calls no cloud API — it only talks to the configured adapters.
