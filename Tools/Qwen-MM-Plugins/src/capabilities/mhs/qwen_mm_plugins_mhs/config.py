One JSON file lists the adapters; the devices behind each one are whatever that adapter reports, so

shared config), overridable with QWEN_MM_MHS_DEVICES.

QWEN_MM_MHS_* vars are capability-private and read through shared.env.get_env, so they resolve from
the environment or the shared config file without being part of that file's advertised catalog.
