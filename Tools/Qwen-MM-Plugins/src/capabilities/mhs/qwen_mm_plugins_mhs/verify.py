"""Conformance checker for a candidate MHS adapter — run it before trusting one.

    python3 -m qwen_mm_plugins_mhs.verify http://127.0.0.1:8800

Exercises the protocol against a live adapter and reports, per check, exactly what is wrong rather
than leaving a subtly non-conformant adapter to surface as vague tool failures later. Written for the
case where an adapter was just authored — including by a model — and nobody has reviewed it.

STRICTLY READ-ONLY. It never calls write, and never calls reset: on real hardware those move things or
stop them, and a checker that actuates equipment to prove it can actuate equipment is not a checker.
Write and reset capabilities are validated by their *declaration* only, and the report says so.

Validation deliberately runs through this package's own protocol module — the same normalize_meta /
to_content_blocks / check_* the server uses. A checker with its own private copy of the rules would
drift from the thing that actually enforces them, and then agree with nobody.
