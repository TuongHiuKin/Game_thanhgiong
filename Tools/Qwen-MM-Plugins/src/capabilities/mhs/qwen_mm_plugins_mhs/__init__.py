"""Qwen-MM-Plugins MHS capability — a Model Hardware Standard host.

MHS is to hardware what MCP is to tools: one narrow surface (discover / meta_info / read / write /
health_check / reset) that a model uses to operate any device, with everything device-specific pushed
behind an *adapter*. Adapters belong to the hardware, not to this plugin — whoever owns a camera
writes and runs its adapter. This package is the host side: it keeps the device registry, enforces
the safety limits an adapter declares, and exposes the fixed tool surface.

Adapters speak MHS-HTTP/1 (HTTP + MessagePack, see skill/references/adapter_protocol.md) and are
listed in ~/.qwen-mm-plugins/mhs-devices.json. Adding a new class of hardware means writing an
adapter and adding a line to that file; it never means changing this package.
