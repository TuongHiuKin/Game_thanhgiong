"""Live device discovery, with a short-lived cache of device metadata.

Device ids are reported to the model *qualified* as "<adapter>/<device_id>", which stays stable when
a second adapter joins and happens to use the same local id. A bare id is still accepted when it is
unambiguous, because that is what a model will naturally type back.

Every discovery reloads the registry file and queries the adapters. Only metadata is cached:
read/write validate the device's declared capabilities and safety limits, so caching these avoids
an extra HTTP request per operation.
