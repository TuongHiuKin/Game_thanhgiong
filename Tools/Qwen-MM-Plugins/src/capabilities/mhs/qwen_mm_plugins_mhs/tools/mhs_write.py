Safety limits and confirmation are checked in this process, before the request is sent. The device is

        capability: Capability name to write, exactly as listed by mhs_meta_info (e.g. 'settings', 'power').
        params: The command's parameters, as documented in the capability's metadata (e.g. {'exposure':
            40}). Values are checked against the device's declared safety limits.
        confirm: Set true only to proceed with a write the device flagged as needing confirmation, or one
            that exceeds a SOFT limit. Hard limits cannot be overridden by this flag. Do not set it
