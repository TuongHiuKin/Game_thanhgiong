# Trailing whitespace inside the prompts is intentional — do not strip it.
"""The prompts a build makes its omni calls with. stages.py fills the {{PLACEHOLDER}} markers.

Every one is a RAW string: the JSON examples inside contain backslash-escaped quotes that a normal
literal would silently unescape.

They are Python rather than .md data files because a wheel install only ships what package-data
covers, and a prompt file that goes missing turns into an empty model call rather than an error.
Keeping them as code makes that impossible.

# Extraction: one omni call per clip over video+audio → a composite {visual, audio} record.
# Part B6 is what binds each spoken line to a person_id.
SW_PROMPT = r"""You are a rigorous, objective **video + audio analyst** operating inside a **sliding-window memory pipeline** with an **accumulative scene-environment memory** and **canonical entity (incl. name) grounding**. You are given one ~30-second video clip (frames **and** an audio track) that is part of a longer video processed as overlapping windows. In a **single pass** produce BOTH parts below, output as **one** JSON object with exactly two top-level keys `visual` and `audio`:

- **(A) VISUAL** — detached third-person record of people/actions/objects/space, plus sliding-window continuity / de-duplication / entity-alignment / accumulative-environment / **name-grounding** signals.
- **(B) AUDIO** — verbatim transcription **with timestamps**, then paralinguistics and environmental sounds.

Division of labour: spoken *words* belong ONLY to audio (verbatim); visual records *visible communicative behavior* but never the words.

================================================================
============== SLIDING-WINDOW INPUT (read this first) ===========
================================================================
This clip is one window of a longer video; windows overlap. Time layout in **absolute original-video seconds**:
- **window_range** (full clip span): {{WINDOW_RANGE}}
- **context_range** (leading overlap already covered by PREVIOUS clip — continuity/alignment ONLY): {{CONTEXT_RANGE}}
- **target_range** (the genuinely NEW portion — PRIMARY source of new memory): {{TARGET_RANGE}}

Clip internal time 0 = start of window_range. **Convert every timestamp to absolute original-video seconds by adding the window-start offset.**
Rules: ① context_range = continuity only, do NOT re-commit. ② target_range = where new memory comes from. ③ if an utterance/action straddles the boundary, record in full and set `boundary_overlap=true`. ④ if context_range is `none`, this is the FIRST clip — whole window is new.

================================================================
========== CONTINUITY PRIOR — previous_state (optional) =========
================================================================
Carried over from previous clip(s). MAY contain: `scene_id`/`scene_summary`, `scene_env_known` (env elements already stored), `known_entities` (each `person_id`, **`name`**, `appearance`, `last_location`, `last_action`), `active_event_id`/`active_event_summary`, and `last_processed_until`.

【previous_state】
{{PREVIOUS_STATE}}

Use it ONLY as a prior to align scene/entity/name/event IDs and to know what is already stored. **Current frames+audio are the only source of facts**; do NOT copy prior facts into your caption/transcript. If a person already has a `name` in `known_entities`, **reuse that name** (don't relabel) unless strong conflicting evidence. If current conflicts with prior, trust current and log in `visual.conflict`. If `none`, cold start.

================================================================
========== SUBTITLE REFERENCE (optional; authoritative) =========
================================================================
{{SUBTITLE}}

(The block above is self-contained: it states exactly how to use — or not use — the subtitle for TRANSCRIPT, SPEAKER, NAME grounding and paralinguistics in THIS clip. Follow it precisely; it overrides the generic wording of Part B where they differ.)

================================================================
============== PART A — VISUAL (top-priority rules) ==============
================================================================
**A1. Only what is truly visible; never hallucinate.** No carry-over of unseen objects/people. POV described objectively ("visible on screen ..."), not first person.
**A2. Hedge/omit easily-confused specifics** (colors, counts, identity, text, clock) unless sure; log in `visual.uncertain`.
**A3. Person-reference:** stable visual descriptors; no bare pronouns. (Canonical IDs/names in A7.)
**A4. No dialogue words here; DO record visible communicative behavior** (who speaks, faces whom, expression, gestures).
**A5. Density first; no filler; no hollow summaries.**

**A6. Sliding-window delta, de-dup & ACCUMULATIVE environment.** Sort what you see into 3 buckets:
- (i) already-stored & unchanged → suppress; list in `visual.duplicate_suppression`.
- (ii) newly-revealed DURABLE environment not in `scene_env_known` → `visual.scene_env_update` (even when `same_scene`; e.g. "whiteboard on left wall", "water dispenser in corner"). `scene_env_update` ≠ transient action.
- (iii) transient new happenings in target_range → `visual.target_range_delta`.
Also set `scene_continuity` (same_scene|new_scene|scene_transition|uncertain); on same_scene reuse prior `scene_id` and keep `visual_caption` focused on what's new. Set `memory_commit_recommendation` (create_event|extend_event|update_entity_state|no_op|uncertain).

**A7. Canonical entity alignment + NAME grounding.** For each person in `key_entities`:
- `person_id`: matched known id (P001…); or `null` + `match_status=new_entity` if clearly new; or `null` + `match_status=uncertain_candidate` if unsure. `candidate_ids` when uncertain. `match_confidence` (high/medium/low). `match_evidence` (e.g. "same scene + same clothing + continuous action", "same seat", "only person present"). `attribute_change` (compatible|conflict|not_observed|new_detail; don't overwrite stored attrs, just flag).
- **NAME grounding** — bind a real name to a person ONLY with explicit evidence; output `name` (or null), `name_confidence` (high/medium/low), `name_evidence`:
  - `self_introduction` — someone says "I'm X / my name is X" → that name belongs to the SPEAKER (cross-check who is speaking). HIGH.
  - `addressed_and_confirmed` — "are you X?" answered "yes", or repeatedly addressed as X and responds → that person. HIGH/MEDIUM.
  - `on_screen` — name tag / slide text. HIGH.
  - `mentioned_uncertain` — a name merely mentioned about someone possibly **absent** (e.g. "Mary will help") → do NOT bind to a visible person; set `name=null`, note candidate in `visual.uncertain`.
  - If `known_entities` already gives this person a name, reuse it (`name_evidence="prior"`).
  - Never bind a name just because it's the only name heard; require the link to be evidenced.

【VISUAL cover when present】 appearance; actions in temporal order; person-object/person-person interaction; key objects w/ state+location; space/setting; temporal cues.

================================================================
============== PART B — AUDIO (top-priority rules) ==============
================================================================
**B1. Verbatim transcription overrides all** — fillers/hesitations kept; no summarize/paraphrase/translate; original language; `[inaudible]` when unsure (never guess); no speech → `transcript`="" and `utterances`=[].
**B2. Paralinguistics from closed sets** (below); `unknown` if undeterminable (`none` for vocal_burst); judge from sound, not words.
**B3. Acoustics open-set** — `acoustic.events` short lowercase phrases ([] if none); `acoustic.scene` short phrase (`unknown` if undeterminable). Speech is not an acoustic event.
**B4. Transcribe first, label second.**
**B5. Timestamps required** — `start_sec`/`end_sec` absolute video seconds; basis in `audio.time_basis`="absolute_video_seconds"; `boundary_overlap` true if straddles context/target boundary. Build `transcript` as `[start-end] speaker: text` lines (use name or person_id if known, else descriptor).
**B6. Audio↔visual speaker alignment** — `speaker_id`=canonical person_id if identifiable else unknown/offscreen; keep `speaker_hint`; `alignment_confidence`; `alignment_evidence`. Don't force a binding.

【Paralinguistic closed sets】 emotion: neutral|happy|sad|angry|anxious|excited|tired|fearful|surprised|frustrated|affectionate|other|unknown · tone: calm|urgent|gentle|harsh|playful|serious|impatient|commanding|pleading|comforting|other|unknown · volume: whisper|low|normal|loud|shouting · rate: slow|normal|fast · pitch: low|normal|high · vocal_burst: laughing|crying|sighing|trembling|yawning|none

# Induction: turn a batch of clips into semantic triples, merging against the keys already stored.
STAGE2_PROMPT = r"""You are a rigorous **multimodal knowledge inducer** for an entity-centric memory system. You are given (a) an ENTITY TABLE (canonical people/objects with ids + grounded names), (b) the EXISTING semantic memory accumulated so far (may be empty), and (c) a NEW BATCH of first-stage episodic memories (visual descriptions + verbatim audio with speaker & paralinguistic tags). Your task: **distill stable, reusable knowledge / preferences / relationships, and task-level aggregated facts**, as triples with a compact retrieval KEY, reconciling against existing memory. Output strict JSON.

================ TOP-PRIORITY RULES ================

**1. Induce stable knowledge & aggregates, do NOT retell one-off events.**
- Target: information that **still holds across time** — intrinsic attributes, role/identity, relationships, habits, **preferences/likes/dislikes**, and **task-level aggregates/decisions** (budgets, who-does-what, plans, scheduled things, required resources).
- A single transient action is NOT a triple ("opened a folder at 12:01" = episodic). A repeated/declared tendency IS ("prefers Chinese food", said he loves photography).

**2. Stable-from-one vs needs-repetition (avoid over-generalization).**
- Stable from a single clear statement (role, a stated preference, a self-introduced name, a decided budget number) → may output with `confidence=medium` (or `high` if explicit & unambiguous, e.g. "I'm Matthew", "prize: 3000 dollars").
- A *habit* claim ("usually/always") needs ≥2 evidences; with one instance, downgrade to a plain attribute/preference or omit.

**3. Evidence required; no hallucination; no mind-reading.**
- Every triple MUST be supported by the batch (or by updating an existing one); list supporting episodic ids (clip indices / timestamps) in `evidence`.
- No guessing motives. When uncertain, omit or mark `confidence=low`.

**4. Entity-centric subjects (use the ENTITY TABLE).**
- For people, set `subject` to the grounded **name** if known (else the descriptor) and `subject_id` to the canonical **person_id** (P00x). Keep consistent with the entity table.
- For task-level facts, use a stable event subject `subject="event:<short_name>"` (e.g. `event:promotion_campaign`), `subject_id` = same string.

**5. predicate ONLY from the ontology; type ONLY from the enum.**

**6. KEY convention** — `subject/short-category[/disambiguator]`, e.g. `Matthew/prefers/food`, `Annie/role`, `event:promotion_campaign/budget/prize`. Short, unique, readable; merge same subject+category under one key.

**7. Reconcile with EXISTING semantic memory (CRUD signals).**
- If this batch SUPPORTS an existing triple (same key/meaning) → `op="update"`, reuse its `key`, add new evidence (the driver will merge & may raise confidence).
- If NEW → `op="create"`.
- If this batch CONTRADICTS an existing triple (same subject+predicate, different object) → still output your best current triple, set `op="update"`, and set `conflicts_with` = the existing key, with a one-line `conflict_note`. (The driver resolves by confidence > evidence-count > recency; loser is soft-superseded.)
- Do not duplicate an unchanged existing triple that this batch says nothing new about — omit it.

==================================================================
【predicate ontology (English key = meaning)】
- attributes: `has_appearance` | `has_attribute` | `has_color`
- location: `usually_located_at` | `belongs_to_place` | `layout_is`

- habit: `habitually_does` | `usually_at_time`
- preference: `prefers` | `dislikes` | `allergic_to`

{
  "triples": [

# Name alignment: work out who is who by reading the cumulative transcript.
ALIGN_PROMPT_TRANSCRIPT = r"""You are resolving the character ROSTER of a long video's memory. A prior pass processed the
video clip-by-clip and detected people as ANONYMOUS entities (P001, P002, …) without binding
names. Your job: determine each entity's real name from the cumulative dialogue transcript.

You are given:
1. PERSONS — canonical people, each an id (P001, P002, …) + visual appearance description.
   NO names are shown — you derive them purely from dialogue evidence.
2. DIALOGUE — the full cumulative conversation in time order. Each line is labeled ONLY by the
   speaker's person id (P001, P002, …), NEVER by name. "offscreen" and "unknown" are NOT people:
   they cover any speech whose source is not a visible person (a voice off-camera, a device or
   assistant replying, a TV, an announcement).

Decide each person's name using ONLY in-dialogue evidence, in this PRIORITY order:
(a) SELF-INTRODUCTION (strongest): "I'm X" / "I am X" / "my name is X" → that speaker is X.
(b) VOCATIVE + RESPONSE: someone says "X, <request>" and the next responder is X.
    NOTE: a bare GREETING ("Hi X") is the WEAKEST vocative — trust only when nothing stronger contradicts.
(c) CHARACTERIZATION / ROLE DESCRIPTION: "X leads the meeting" → map to the person whose role matches.

CRITICAL RULES:
- **A name said BY a person to ADDRESS someone else is the LISTENER's name, never the speaker's.**
  Example: P001 says "Hello Emma" → "Emma" is NOT P001's name; it likely refers to whoever P001
  is talking to (check who responds next).
- **A word used to address a NON-PERSON is not a person name.** If someone addresses a device,
  an assistant or a voice off-camera and the reply comes from "offscreen" / "unknown" rather than
  from a person, the addressed word names that non-person — do NOT assign it to any person_id.
  This also covers mis-transcriptions of such a word into something that looks like a real name.
  Only bind a name when the one being addressed, introduced or described is a visible person.
- **COUNT THE PEOPLE.** Never assign the same name to two different person_ids.
- If TWO different names point to the SAME person, one is a mis-transcription. Keep the one with
  STRONGER evidence (more occurrences, clearer context).
- Do NOT invent names. If no clear evidence exists → name = null.
- This is an INCREMENTAL process — you may be called multiple times as the video progresses.
  Base your decision on ALL available evidence. If you previously assigned a name but new evidence
  contradicts it, correct it.
