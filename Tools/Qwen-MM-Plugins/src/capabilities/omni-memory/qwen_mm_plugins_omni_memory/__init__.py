"""Qwen-MM-Plugins omni-memory: stateful streaming memory for long videos.

One omni model reads each 30s window together with its in-video audio, so identities, dialogue and
speaker attribution come out of a single pass — there is no separate ASR or diarization stage.

This package is the READ side only; building lives in skill/script/build_memory/ (see SKILL.md).

  omni_core   what the build and the read path share: clients, throttling, vector codec, StoreBase
  mem_core    MemoryStore — the store plus hybrid retrieval over it
  watch       answering off the video itself: payload sizing, re-encoding, watch and replay calls
  text_match  tokenising, BM25 constants, cosine, RRF, phonetic name matching
  service     locating and caching a memory; what more than one tool needs
