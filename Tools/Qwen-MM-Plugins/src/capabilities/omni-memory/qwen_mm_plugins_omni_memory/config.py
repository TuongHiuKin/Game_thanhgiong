"""Which model endpoints the SERVER talks to. Everything is settings-driven; see USAGE_NOTE in __init__.

Read through shared.env.get_env rather than os.environ, which adds the ~/.qwen-mm-plugins/config
fallback that `install.sh` and `--setup` write — the only way a GUI-launched harness (Claude desktop,
Codex) sees a credential, since those do not inherit a shell's exports. The environment still wins.

The build mirrors this file in skill/script/build_memory/env_config.py, which cannot import `shared`.
Everything below the marker is identical in both, pinned by
tests/test_omni_memory.py::test_the_two_config_readers_stay_identical: a build and a server that
disagree about the endpoint or model would fail in a way nobody thinks to look for.
