"""What the build path and the query path both need, and nothing else.

Config-derived endpoints and credentials, the omni and embedding clients, throttling/stall handling,
the vector codec, ffmpeg duration probing, the name-alignment stopword table, and StoreBase — the
memory containers plus the serialization both sides have to agree on.

TWO COPIES OF THIS FILE EXIST AND MUST STAY IDENTICAL:
  qwen_mm_plugins_omni_memory/omni_core.py          (the MCP server reads memories with it)
  skill/script/build_memory/omni_core.py            (the build script writes them with it)

Neither copy can import the other: some harnesses install a skill by copying skill/ alone, so the
build script cannot count on the server package being near it, and the wheel does not ship skill/.
Hence a copy rather than a shared module — the same trade video-memory makes with schema.py and
embeddings.py.

tests/test_omni_memory.py::test_the_two_copies_of_omni_core_stay_identical compares every line below
the marker, so editing one copy fails until the other matches. The format two programs write and read
must never drift silently.
