"""Qwen-MM-Plugins search: web + reverse-image search for confirming facts.

A pure-tools MCP server. Each module under ``tools/`` exports ``TOOL`` + ``handle`` and is
auto-discovered by the framework. ``web_search`` and ``web_extractor`` support Serper, Exa,
Tavily, and Serply through the package-local backend adapters. ``image_search`` uses Serper Lens.
