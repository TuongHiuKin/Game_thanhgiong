    """Temporal grounding: given a text query, locate the time segment(s) in an audio/video where it
    occurs, returning start/end seconds per match, using the Qwen-Omni model (reads frames + audio).
    This is temporal grounding (WHEN) — for spatial grounding (WHERE in a frame), use core's tool.
    A local file is uploaded inline, where the endpoint caps a media item at 10 MB of base64, so it
    is transcoded to fit — about 9 min at the default 1 fps / 448² sampling. A longer local video is
    delivered another way automatically: uploaded to OSS when OSS_* is configured (no size limit),
    else split into sampled frames plus its full audio track — at which point the frame spacing
    bounds visual timestamp precision (the audio timeline stays continuous). Passing an http(s)/OSS
    URL keeps full sampling (fetched server-side), as does grounding within a trimmed clip.

    Args:
        file_path: Absolute path to a local audio/video file, or an http(s)/OSS URL.
        query: What to locate, in natural language (e.g. 'the goal celebration', 'when the speaker
            mentions pricing').
        top_k: Max number of matching segments to return (default: all found).
        fps: Video sampling fps (default 1.0).
        max_pixels: Per-frame pixel budget (default 200704 ≈ 448²).
        model: Omni model id override. Defaults to QWEN_MM_API_OMNI_MODEL, then qwen3.8-omni-flash.
        api_key: API key override; otherwise selected by endpoint.
        base_url: OpenAI-compatible base URL override.
        dry_run: Return the request that would be sent, without calling the API.
